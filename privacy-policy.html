    <h1>Privacy Policy for HappinessJar</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated: April 2025</strong></p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Thank you for choosing HappinessJar. We are committed to protecting your personal information and your right to privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and share information when you use our application.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>HappinessJar is designed to be a private, personal application. We do not collect any personal information from you. All memories, photos, and data you create in the app are stored locally on your device and are not transmitted to our servers or any third parties.</p>

    <h2>Local Storage</h2>
    <p>The app stores all your memories, including text and photos, only on your device's local storage. We do not have access to this data, nor do we back it up on remote servers.</p>

    <h2>Camera and Photo Library</h2>
    <p>HappinessJar requires access to your device's camera and photo library to allow you to add photos to your memories. These photos are only stored locally on your device and are not shared with us or any third party.</p>

    <h2>Device Sensors</h2>
    <p>The app uses your device's motion sensors (accelerometer) to detect shaking for the "shake for random memory" feature. This data is processed only on your device and is not collected or transmitted elsewhere.</p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>HappinessJar does not automatically share any of your data. The app includes a feature that allows you to manually share memories with others through your device's sharing capabilities. When you choose to share a memory, you control who receives it and what information is included.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our application is suitable for users of all ages. Since we do not collect personal information, there are no special provisions for children's data.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date.</p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at:</p>
